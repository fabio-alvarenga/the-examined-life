"The unexamined life is not worth living." (Socrates)

### Status of this project
Just started. Literally, I haven't written a single line of code yet.
### Goals
1. Be a welcoming environment for programmers and (specially!) non-programmers to start using quantified-self tools.
2. Always open-source and self-hostable. Personal data this important shouldn't be collected nor processed.
3. Infinitely extensible. Plugins as first-class citizens. (Do you use Toggl? Clockify? You should be able to import your data here regardless of which tool you use.)
4. Customizable data points and correlations.
