"The unexamined life is not worth living." (Socrates)
### Status of this project
Just started. Literally, I haven't written a single line of code yet.
### How to decide what to track?
Tracking is a time-consuming effort. So not everything should be tracked. We can try to automate most of the entries, but others are inherently manual (or at least, up until now!)
A good rule of thumb for choosing which data you should track is answering the following questions:
1. How useful is this data? What is it gonna tell me? 
2. Can it be automated?

If it's useful, and can provide you with valuable insights, then it's probably good to track.
If it can be automated: bonus points.
### Design goals
1. Be a welcoming environment for programmers and (specially!) non-programmers to start using quantified-self tools.
2. Always open-source and self-hostable. Personal data this important shouldn't be collected nor processed.
3. Infinitely extensible. Plugins as first-class citizens. (Do you use Toggl? Clockify? You should be able to import your data here anyway.)
4. Customizable data points and correlations.
